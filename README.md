# 📨 Nyron – Lightweight Chat App (v0.01)

**Nyron** is an open-source, minimalist alternative to Telegram and Discord, focused on speed, simplicity, and clean design. The goal is to build a fully functional, privacy-respecting messaging platform that's lightweight, community-driven, and actively updated.

> ⚠️ This is an early version (v0.01). Currently, Nyron is an **unfinished frontend-only prototype** – no real messaging yet. Just the barebones UI structure is in place.
